Hello! I'm Reid, I used to work here at [GitHub](https://github.com/), and now I work at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) managing the Developer Platform. I am the author of this text you are currently reading.

Beyond programming and managing engineering teams, I enjoy:

- Cooking with my wife, Kara
- Trying to convince my dog, Sylvia, to cuddle
- Drinking wine, making cocktails
- Photography, biking, and playing banjo
- Haskell, databases, and data structures
