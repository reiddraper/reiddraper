Hello! I'm Reid, I work here at GitHub, and I am also the author of this text you are currently reading.

Beyond managing an engineering team at GitHub, I enjoy:

- Cooking with my wife, Kara
- Trying to convince my dog, Sylvia, to cuddle
- Drinking wine, making cocktails
- Photography, biking, and playing banjo
- Haskell, databases, and data structures
